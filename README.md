# PunishMe
Just a quick note, this is another request by *xOrlxndo*. I hope you enjoy!

**PunishMe** is a Bukkit plugin which allows custom incremental punishments for players. By default this is set up to work with [MuteManager](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/mutemanager/) by *cnaude*.

## Commands

Usage | Description
----- | -----------
`/punish <name> <reason>` | Punish the given player for the given reason
`/punishme [reload|save]` | If you don't specify a param it prints the version text, `reload` reloads the config, `save` saves all player data to the `players.yml` file
